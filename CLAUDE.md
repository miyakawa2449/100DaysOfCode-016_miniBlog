# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **high-feature block-based blog CMS system** built with Flask and SQLAlchemy. The project is a sophisticated content management system featuring an advanced block editor with 5 block types, WordPress import functionality, 2FA authentication, and comprehensive security measures.

**Current Status**: ~95% complete - fully functional CMS ready for production use.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.10, Flask 2.x, SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: SQLite with Flask-Migrate
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5, ES6+ JavaScript, Sortable.js, Cropper.js
- **Security**: Flask-Login, TOTP/2FA, Flask-WTF CSRF protection
- **Content**: Markdown processing, Bleach HTML sanitization, PIL image processing

## Architecture Overview

### Core Application Structure
- `app.py` - Main Flask application with public routes (25+ endpoints)
- `admin.py` - Admin panel Blueprint with protected routes (20+ endpoints)
- `models.py` - SQLAlchemy database models (User, Article, Category, Block, etc.)
- `forms.py` - WTForms for general forms
- `block_forms.py` - WTForms specifically for block types
- `block_utils.py` - Utilities for block processing and validation
- `wordpress_importer.py` - WordPress XML import functionality

### Block Editor System (Core Innovation)
The block editor is the standout feature of this CMS:

**5 Block Types**:
1. **Text/Markdown Block**: Full Markdown support with real-time preview
2. **Image Block**: 1:1 ratio (700Ã—700px) with Cropper.js integration
3. **Featured Image Block**: 16:9 ratio (800Ã—450px) for article headers
4. **SNS Embed Block**: X(Twitter), Facebook, Instagram, Threads, YouTube support
5. **External Article Block**: Automatic OGP data fetching with preview cards

**Advanced Features**:
- **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Sortable.js integration
- **Real-time Preview**: Instant updates via AJAX
- **Display Mode Selection**: Embed vs OGP card display for SNS content
- **Automatic Platform Detection**: Smart SNS URL parsing
- **Image Processing**: Real-time cropping and optimization

### Database Design
- **Users**: Authentication, profiles, 2FA settings, roles (admin/author)
- **Articles**: Title, slug, summary, status, publication dates
- **Categories**: Hierarchical structure with parent-child relationships
- **Blocks**: Polymorphic block storage with order management
- **Many-to-Many**: Articles â†” Categories via `article_categories` table
- **Settings**: Site configuration and customization options

### Security Architecture
- **2FA Required**: TOTP/Google Authenticator for admin access
- **Role-based Access**: Admin vs Author permission levels
- **CSRF Protection**: Flask-WTF on all forms
- **Input Sanitization**: Bleach for HTML content, file upload validation
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with timeouts

## Common Commands

python app.py          # Start development server (port 5001)
flask run              # Alternative way to start server
```

### Database Management
```bash
flask db migrate -m "description"    # Generate new migration
flask db upgrade                     # Apply pending migrations
flask db downgrade                   # Rollback last migration
```

```

### Testing
```bash
python test_system_stability.py     # System stability test
python test_admin_functionality.py  # Admin panel functionality test

## Development Notes

### Block Development
When extending block functionality:
1. Add new block type to `models.py` constants
2. Create form class in `block_forms.py`
3. Add template in `templates/blocks/`
4. Update processing logic in `block_utils.py`
5. Add block macro to `templates/macros/block_macros.html`

### Database Changes
Always use migrations for schema changes:
1. Modify models in `models.py`
2. Run `flask db migrate -m "description"`
3. Review generated migration file carefully
4. Test migration on development data
5. Run `flask db upgrade`

### Security Considerations
- All admin routes require 2FA authentication
- File uploads are validated and restricted
- HTML content is sanitized with Bleach
- CSRF tokens required on all forms
- Session timeouts and secure cookie settings
